Challenge Category,Traditional System Challenges,Hydraulic System Solutions
Force Limitation,Limited by human foot force (700N max),Force amplification overcomes limitation
Voltage Output,Low voltage requires complex boost circuits,High voltage reduces circuit complexity
Energy Storage,Small energy per step requires large capacitors,Large energy per step enables smaller storage
Mechanical Durability,Piezo fatigue under repeated stress,Hydraulic system protects piezo from damage
Environmental Resistance,Moisture sensitivity in outdoor applications,Sealed hydraulic system provides protection
Frequency Matching,Narrow resonance frequency range,Pulse-based system less frequency dependent
Implementation Complexity,Simple but limited performance,Complex but much higher performance
Scalability Issues,Many small units needed for useful power,Fewer high-power units needed
